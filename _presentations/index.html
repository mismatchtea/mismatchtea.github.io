<h1>presentations</h1>

<p>The presentations listed below contain minimal information for a variety of topics and are designed to support key ideas through diagrams, examples and exercises. They are not meant as notes for students. They will be updated as I teach topics again. </p>

<p>These presentations are PDF files. In order to run them as a presentation in <a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/">Adobe Reader</a> use <code>ctrl + L </code> (windows). </p>
