Welcome to my new site. This is the blog of a maths teacher in North Lincolnshire. Having taught for over 4 years I thought it would be useful to record and reflect upon some of some of my experiences in the classroom, including

* lessons
* resources
* pedagogy
* professional development

## starting points
Here are some aspects of teaching I have been using recently and intend to look at in more detail in future posts.

### GeoGebra
[GeoGebra][geogebra] is a powerful open source geometry and algebra software that I feel is under-used in secondary education. There are wonderful resources on the [GeoGebraTube][geogebratube] site that are ready to use. 

### inquiry tasks
Inquiry tasks are a step back from investigations and allow students more control of their progress in lessons as they explore a given prompt. Andrew Blair's website gives details of [inquiry maths][inquiry] and includes lots of resources. I have tried a couple and have been delighted by the results.

### latex
A lot of my resources are typeset using $$\LaTeX{}$$. Some ways in which I use it include

* A-level presentations - Beamer class
* assessments - Exam class
* diagrams - tikz (with a little help from GeoGebra)
