Flexagons were created by the late [Martin Gardner][mg]. Having made tri-hexaflexagons with a class recently, I asked students to colour one side red, one amber and the last one green so that they could use them in future lessons for AfL.

## creating a tri-hexaflexagon
tri-hexaflexagons have 3 distinct sides. In order for the flexagons to "flex" each step needs to be completed **as accurately as possible.**

### step 1
Download and print out the [template][template]. Cut around the outside then make a sharp fold along each line, making sure to fold both forwards and backwards. Orient the template as follows.

![step1][step1]

### step 2
Fold the three marked triangles *towards you* to make the following:

![step2][step2]

### step 3
Leave the next two triangles, then make a fold *away from you* as follows:

![step3][step3]

### step 4
Pick up the the piece that was just folded backwards and lift it to the front:

![step4][step4]

### step 5
Turn over the flexagon and glue down the remaining tab before colouring it in. Patterns work best when drawn to the centre points of each triangle. The following patterns work well. The thick line represents the three "flaps" on each face.

### flexing
To flex the flexagon, pinch one of the flaps with the hand you write with whilst simultaneously pushing the opposite fold with your other hand. You should then be able to open up the middle to reveal the missing side. With practice and a bit of use the flexagons should flex easily.
