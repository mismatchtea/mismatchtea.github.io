I haven't posted on the blog in 2015 - which there's really no excuse for.

I have loads of ideas for posts so to kick things off the site has been redesigned and is now hosted on [GitHub Pages][pages]. It's gone from this...

![old][old]

... to this ...

![new][new]

It's still work in progress, but it's getting there.

Some of the resources have been reorganised behind the scenes, so I hope this doesn't cause anything to break. This is to get things ready for the [resources][resources] section of the site.

[resources]: /resources
[pages]: https://pages.github.com/

[new]: {{site.postAssets}}/2015/0818-new.png
