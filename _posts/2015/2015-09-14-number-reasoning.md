![exam question][examQuestion]

The above was taken from question 1 of the [June 2013 Edexcel Higher][paper] paper. The examiners report for this question stated:

some of the best candidates. Commonly seen incorrect answers included 17.93. 
An estimate (300000 รท 2) could have helped candidates with this part of the 
question.
