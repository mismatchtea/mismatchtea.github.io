[Here's][pdf] a starter inspired by a problem in the excellent [Cabinet of Curiosities][amazon] book by Ian Stewart.

[![pdf][image]][pdf]

The names of 10 students are displayed around the diagram. Start from 'Mister Mort' and move clockwise along one edge for each letter as a name is spelled out. You should finish on that person's name.

## create your own
It's unlikely that your name is also Mr Mort and that you happen to teach a Michelangelo, so you can create your own version [here][overleaf-write].

* follow the link to Overleaf
* replace the names at the top of the file with words of length 3 - 12 (I have had to use first names and last names in the past to make up the longer names)
* make sure the starting point has length 10
* the preview should automatically update
* download the pdf from the menu at the top

**NOTE:** The above file is shared on Overleaf and can be edited by anyone, so if the file has been edited and is not usable then there is a read-only version [here][overleaf-read]. You will need to copy the code, create a new paper and paste it into the new document.
