[Here][resource] is a peer-marked afl activity I made for a low ability year 7 class:

[![resource-image][resource-image]][resource]

## the activity
* I presented the first slide to the students and asked them to complete it to the best of their ability within 5 minutes.

* I then asked them to swap books and have a look at what their partner had produced. They were then shown the second slide and asked to mark it according to the success criteria on slide 3.

* Students then gave written feedback based on the success criteria.

*  Having swapped their books back, students produced a 'perfect' version of the bar chart.

## the rest of the lesson
I didn't need to teach anything further in the lesson, they had received sufficient feedback to draw bar charts for various sets of data. Sorted.
