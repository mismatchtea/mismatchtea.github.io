Having read a superb post about the Singapore Bar Model from [William Emeny][gmti] I thought I would share these diagrams for introducing equivalent fractions: 

[![first][first]][first]

Students identify that $$\frac{5}{12}$$ of the diagram is shaded blue.

[![second][second]][second]

With each square now shown in two pieces, they can then see that $$\frac{10}{24}$$ is shaded and that this is equivalent to $$\frac{5}{12}$$.

[![third][third]][third]

Once they are happy with the second step then there isn't much of a leap to showing that $$\frac{20}{48} = \frac{10}{24} = \frac{5}{12}$$.

Whilst these diagrams are given in a slightly different format to the bar model, the idea is similar.

## presentation
[Here][presentation] is a small presentation that may be useful.
