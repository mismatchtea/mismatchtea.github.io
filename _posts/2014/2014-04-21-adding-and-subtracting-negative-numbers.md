Teaching negative numbers to students is often difficult due to the fact that some of the rules are counter-intuitive. The greatest sticking point comes when students are faced with calculations with touching symbols such as 

$$  -7 -^{-}9 $$

The rest of the post focuses on how to introduce this concept to students.

## discs
 The method I have had the most success with is similar to the approach described in [getting the buggers to add up][buggers] by Mike Ollerton. This <a href="{{site.postAssets}}/2014/0421-negatives.pdf" download>pdf</a> can be used to visualise the four options for touching symbols. To run it as a presentation press ```ctrl + L``` on Adobe Reader for Windows or ```cmd + L``` on Mac. The presentation is used as follows:

### determine the value of the starting image
 Each disc has a value of $$ \pm 1 $$, so the initial image has a net value of $$ 0 $$. The next image has a value of $$ 2 $$, and this forms the start of the first example. The key to this method is to define the first symbol of the touching pair as an instruction: **addition** as drawing extra discs and **subtraction** as removing discs. The second of the touching symbols describes the type of disc to draw or remove.

### adding positives

The first example is $$ 2 + ^ {+} 4 $$ and the presentation shows four positive discs being drawn. This should demonstrate

$$ 2 + ^ {+} 4 = 6 = 2 + 4 $$

or that two $$ ++ $$ symbols can be replaced by $$ + $$.

### adding negatives

[![pm][pm]][pdf]

Continuing where the last example concluded, consider $$ 6 + ^ {-} 5 $$. This time we are adding, so are drawing $$ 5 $$ more negative discs. This gives

$$ 6 + ^ {-} 5 = 1 = 6-5 $$

or that $$ +- $$ symbols touching can be replaced by $$ - $$.

### subtracting positives

[![mp][mp]][pdf]

Now looking at $$ -+ $$. The first symbol of $$ - $$ tells us that we are removing discs now. The given example is $$ 1 - ^ {+} 6 $$, so $$ 6 $$ positive discs are removed, leading to

$$ 1 - ^ {+} 6 = -5 = 1-6$$

therefore if $$ -+ $$ are touching then they can be replaced by $$ - $$.

### subtracting negatives

Finally, the counter-intuitive calculation: $$ - - $$. The example is $$ -5 - ^ {-} 8 $$. By now the students should be able to explain that this means removing $$ 8 $$ negative discs. The presentation shows this is

$$ -5 - ^ {-} 8 = 3 = -5 + 8$$

and hence $$ -- $$ symbols touching can be replaced by $$ + $$.

### notes
Here are the four examples again with the final table I ask students to record in their books:

$$ \begin{align*}
    2 + ^{+} 4 &= 2 + 4 = 6 \\
    6 + ^{-} 5 &= 6 - 5 = 1 \\
    1 - ^{+} 6 &= 1 - 6 = -5 \\
    -5 - ^{-} 8 &= -5 + 8 = 3
\end{align*}
$$

which is often written as 

$$ \begin{align*}
    ++ & = + \\
    +- & = - \\
    -+ & = - \\
    -- & = +
\end{align*}
$$


## other methods
When I have asked colleagues about their method for teaching this concept there have been a variety of other methods used:

* **sand castles and holes**: a variation of the method described above. There is an excellent PowerPoint on [mrbartonmaths.com][barton].
* **profit and debt**: students are given slips of paper with various amounts of money on. Removing some of the debt increases the amount of money a student has. I feel that discussing applications to money is most beneficial once students have a firm understanding of how to deal with touching symbols
* finally there is another good discussion of the problem of touching symbols on [nrich][nrich].
