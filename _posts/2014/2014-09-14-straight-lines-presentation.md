I'm starting to put together presentations for A-level this year. I'm starting with Core 1 and creating materials to support the course. The aim is to create presentations with key examples and diagrams as a visual aid in lessons, rather than step-by-step notes for students to copy.

The presentation is a pdf and designed to be shown fullscreen. On [Adobe Reader][reader] use ```ctrl + L ``` (windows) or on Preview for Mac use ```cmd + shift + F ```.

The amount of information is minimal so that students must make their own notes and complete solutions to the examples.

The presentation can be printed from the following pdf:

The plan is to create a resources section on the website to store all the materials for A-level as they're created, so make sure to keep checking back.

## info
The presentation is made using the Beamer class for $$\LaTeX{}$$. It is based on the [Stolkholm][stockholm] Theme by Mark Olson which in turn is based on the [HSRM][hsrm] theme by Benjamin Weiss. The diagrams are created using a package called [TikZ][tikz] and then animated using Beamer's overlays.
