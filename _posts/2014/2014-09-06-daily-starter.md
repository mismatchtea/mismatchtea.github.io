A couple of years ago I was a very nomadic teacher - never teaching in the same room twice on any given day. This gave me numerous issues at the starts of lessons, so I needed an activity to get students doing some maths that required little to no preparation. My solution:

## solution
I came up with the following worksheet:

[![image-print][image-print]][resource-print]

* students glue a copy into the front cover of their exercise books so that they have them available at all times.
* as I enter the room I write down the letters of questions they are to attempt and a number to substitute for the star. For example:

$$\star = 23 \qquad \text{C, D, M}$$

I often use the day of the month, but anything will do. The worksheet provides a huge number of questions with little to no preparation from the teacher.

This sheet has made the start of my lessons much smoother and gives students a routine for the start of lessons.

## for the wall
If you have your own room and would like to display a larger version on the wall then this is for you:
