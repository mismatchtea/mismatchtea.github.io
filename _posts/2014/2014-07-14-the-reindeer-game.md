Just a quick follow on from my [previous post][pirate] about The Pirate Game. [Here][reindeer] is a spreadsheet for [The Reindeer Game][resource]. 

[![reindeerpic][reindeerpic]][reindeer]

I know this is a little out of season but I thought I would get both resources done together.

## EDIT - selecting the next square
Unfortunately the dialogue box that appears for 'choose next square' gives the incorrect coordinates, but it does work correctly if you just click on the required square in the grid and hit 'OK' (there's no need to type in the coordinates).
